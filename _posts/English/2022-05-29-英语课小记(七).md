# 句子

-   一些康奈尔大学的科研人员从出汗现象中获得灵感，研发出一种能在温度升高时自动排汗的柔软的机器人手爪.

    >   Some Cornell University researchers have taken their inspiration from perspiration and developed a soft robotic gripper that automatically starts sweating when temperatures rise.

-   柔软的机器人因其湿软的构造，与金属机器人相比，有时适应性和耐用性更强，受损的可能性较小。

    >   Thanks to their squishy construction, soft robots are sometimes more adaptable and durable-and can be less likely to cause injury-than their metallic counterparts.

-   我们不需要添加传感器或者其他部件来控制机器人出汗速度。局部温度超过过渡温度时，孔隙就会完全自动地开合.

    >   We did not need to add sensors or other components to control the sweating rate of robots. 
    >   When the local temperature rose above the transition, the pores would simply open and close on their own.

-   在手爪的手指上添加一些孔隙，它就能以出汗的方式排出自身的一些水分，但液体必须要有控制地渗漏，否则手爪就会过快地干瘪。

    >   Adding pores to the gripper finger would allow it to release some of its water as sweat. 
    >   But the liquid would have to leak out in a controlled fashion, or the gripper would deflate too quickly.

-   使我们真正设想出具有仿生能力的这种机器人是这个领域的主要贡献之一。以前使用传统的机器人技术，不可能做到这一点。

    >   One of the main contributions of this field is really to make us imagine this kind of robot with lifelike abilities, something that was not possible before, with traditional robotics technology.

-   Beyond gripping, Laschi notes, soft robots have a wide variety of potential applications. "One of them is the biomedical field, because you can apply soft robots in surgery, rehabilitation and assistance to people," she says. Because they are more compatible with fragile human bodies, Laschi adds, these types of robots are good in situations in which a machine must make direct contact with a person.
    
    >   拉斯基指出，除了拿握物体，柔软的机器人有更广泛的潜在应用价值。她说 “其中之一是在生物医学领域，你可以把柔软的机器人用于手术、康复以及为人们提供其他帮助。”拉斯基补充道，由于柔软的机器人与脆弱的人体更加契合，在机器必领与人有直接接触的情况下，柔软的机器人很适用.
    
-   Another issue is the fact that grippers lose some of their friction when covered with slippery water. 
    The researchers suggest that future versions might be made of a material that wrinkles when wet--like human fingers do--increasing the ability to grip. 
    Ultimately, the current prototype is a proof of concept: it demonstrates that perspiration is a viable cooling method for soft robots and gives scientists a platform they can continue to modify and improve.
    
    >   另外一个现实问题是，手爪表面被水分覆盖后变得湿滑，失去部分摩擦力。研究人员提议，未来的机器人手爪可使用湿润时出现褶皱的材料，就像人类的手指一样，这样可以提高抓握能力。最重要的是，目前的雏形验证了科学家的构想：它表明出汗是柔软的机器人散热的可行方法，为科学家继续进行改进和提升打下基础。
